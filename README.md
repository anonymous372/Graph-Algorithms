# Graph-Algorithms

## Listing the algorithms I have created in this Repo
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Floyd Warshall
* Prim's Min Spanning Tree
* Top Sort
* Strongly Connected Components
### and some more unnamed algorithms like for Finding bridging edges in a graph, N Queen Problem, Finding minimum distance of 2 points in a 2D Maze using BFS.
